    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>For my website, I created a marketing website for Coca-Cola. I added a 3D model of a can with an opening animation and sound effect, as well as a crushed version of the can.</p>

    <h2>3D Models</h2>
    <p>For this module, I created Coke, Sprite, and Dr Pepper cans, each on their own webpage. I built an animation for the Coke can where the ring pull and tab move as though opening the can. A crushed can model was also created as a separate animation.</p>

    <div class="row text-center my-4">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="assets/images/pic1.jpg" alt="Coke Model" class="img-fluid rounded">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="assets/images/pic2.jpg" alt="Sprite Model" class="img-fluid rounded">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="assets/images/pic3.jpg" alt="Dr Pepper Model" class="img-fluid rounded">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>For Sprite and Dr Pepper, I designed a different opening mechanism and unique animations showing the bottles being crushed.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>I integrated the can model within a responsive canvas using Bootstrap and added a navigation bar. Custom CSS was used to improve the interactivity and aesthetics of the interface. I used Three.js to apply a Hemisphere Light for ambient lighting, and a Spot Light with a dat.GUI panel for user-controlled lighting effects.</p>
    <p>The 3D models were loaded using Three.js. I also created interactive buttons for users to open the can, switch models, and play the crushing animation.</p>

    <div class="text-center my-4">
      <img src="assets/images/pic4.jpg" alt="Design Example" class="img-fluid rounded">
    </div>

    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>I edited and enhanced audio using Adobe Audition, synchronizing it with the animations when they played on the website. I also added images to the landing page that resize responsively based on screen size using CSS.</p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>I implemented orbit controls so users can freely rotate the 3D model. A toggle button was added to switch between different models inside the Bootstrap canvas, making the experience more dynamic and interactive.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>I conducted several walkthroughs to test functionality and usability. The background color was modified to make the design feel more vibrant. I center-aligned the layout and bolded key text for better readability.</p>

    <h2>Deeper Understanding</h2>
    <p>Beyond the lab videos, I independently developed and integrated three completely different models. I refined the layout and style continuously, aiming for a unique and cohesive visual identity for the site.</p>

    <div class="row text-center my-4">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="assets/images/pic5.jpg" alt="Deeper Understanding Image 1" class="img-fluid rounded">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="assets/images/pic6.jpg" alt="Deeper Understanding Image 2" class="img-fluid rounded">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Implementation and Publication</h2>
    <p>An About page was added to provide context. I zipped the website folder and tested it in Visual Studio Code to confirm that it works as expected after extraction.</p>
